# The Internet - Automation Project

## Introduction
The internet: https://the-internet.herokuapp.com/
is a website that enables different features to automate, with the goal to exercise Automation 
knowledge. Some of the features are login, dropdowns, file upload, javaScript alerts, etc.

The test case automated is the following:
So far I have my automated test cases for the login form. 3 test cases were added:
1) successAuthentication: verifies a succesful login for a given username and password.
2) FailedAuthentication: verifies the error message for an incorrect username and password.
3) IncorrectPassword: verifies the error message for a correct username but incorrect password.

#### *IDE:
Eclipse.

#### *Test automation framework:
Selenium.

#### *Selenium tool:
Selenium WebDriver.

#### *Programming language:
Java.

#### Framework:
Created a project Using Maven for build, execution, and dependency purpose. 
I defined a standardized maven project: 

* src/test/java: Authentication package where there is one class that has 3 different scenarios for the login feature.
* src/main/java: in this package is stored everything related to my framework needed to give support to my automated test cases.
1) Pages: implemented page object model pattern to separate element locators from the test cases, every page has its own class with
the elements needed to interact with and the methods to give behavior to that elements. 
2) resources: so far I have the base class with all the configurations needed for my driver, implicit wait, which browser to execute the
test cases.
3) configurations: the properties file is inside this package, this file contains some data to use in my test cases, browser, environment
url.

#### *Testing Framework:
Using TestNG for Assertions, Grouping, and Parallel execution.

#### *Version Control:
GIT.
